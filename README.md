# Bank Marketing Campaign ‚Äì Classifier Comparison

This project compares four machine learning models ‚Äî Logistic Regression, KNN, Decision Tree, and SVM ‚Äî to predict whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit based on campaign data from a Portuguese bank.

## Business Objective
Improve marketing efficiency by predicting customer subscription likelihood and optimizing outreach strategies.

## Models Evaluated
- Logistic Regression (balanced)
- K-Nearest Neighbors (sampled for performance)
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)

## Key Findings
- Best model based on F1 Score / ROC AUC: ** **
- High class imbalance requires careful metric selection (F1, ROC AUC).
- Logistic Regression provides interpretable coefficients.
- Decision Tree and SVM offer good performance on test data.

## Recommendations
- Deploy top-performing model in pilot campaigns.
- Monitor model drift and real-world ROI.
- Explore ensemble models and real-time scoring.
